This is the sample project to show Web UI Test Automated Testing Framework for any web based project. 
It uses Selenium Web Driver in POM structure with TestNG.

## Getting Started

To start with framework building, you need to do following steps:
```
1. Environment Setup - Setup the development environment on the local machine by installing prerequisites.
2. Project Setup - Git Clone the UI_test_auto_template_prj repo on your local machine.
3. Writing Project's Automated Cases - Start writing Page Objects, Step definitions and Feature Files
